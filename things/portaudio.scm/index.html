					"Sound" is one of these weird handwave-y ideas that doesn't easily fit
					into our usual abstractions. Is it an array of samples? Is it a stream
					of ~data~? What's the deal here?
				</p>
				<p>
					I took 21M.361 with Peter Whincop this spring and decided to write
					some tools for making sounds in Scheme. Like most languages, MIT
					Scheme doesn't have any audio functions in the standard library, so I
					had to write bindings for a C library that can read and write to
					/dev/dsp. I chose portaudio though maybe I should have chosen soundio.

					Visual History is a Chrome extension in collaboration with
					<a href="http://kennethfriedman.org/">Kenny Friedman</a>
					that delinearizes your browsing history with a richer alternative to
					the Back and Forward buttons. Instead of a stack of previously visited
					destinations, Visual History maintains the forest of trees that
					represent each tab’s path around the internet, and lets you easily
					backtrack to any site you’ve recently visited.
