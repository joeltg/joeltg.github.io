					Turing proposes reducing the bandwidth of communication from normal
					interaction to texting.

				<p>
					But take it a step further, and image an imitation game where the
					participants can only send binary dots across some telegraph wire -
					likely any sporatic variant on echoing will convince a judge.
					Intuitively, one would say that "It isn't enough information to really
					capture thought" and then we have a slippery slope from face-to-face
					interaction to texting to telegraphing. Who's to say what's "enough" -
					perhaps Turing's proposal is just well-placed on the slope to still
					stimulate interest and (so far) elude computation.
