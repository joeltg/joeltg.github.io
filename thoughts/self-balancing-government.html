					The
					<a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)"
						>Master Theorem</a
					>
					for solving recurrences has three cases:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						The recurrence tree is top-heavy and almost all the work is done in
						the beginning
					</li>
					<li>
						The recurrence tree is bottom-heavy and almost all the work is done
						at the end
					</li>
					<li>
						The recurrence tree is magically balanced such that the work is
						divided evenly among all the layers of the tree
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					The third case is really profound, and it could have application in
					politics. Modern democracies are like B-trees: short height, huge
					block size, wide spread. This is simple, but doesn't do a very good
					job of distributing responsibility: presidents are elected on simple
					partisan issues because they're the ones that voters relate to. Nodes
					have too high a branching factor to really be in touch with their
					constituent children, and there are too many constituent children in
					each block for any of them to feel like they really matter.
				</p>
				<p>
					But instead imagine a government more like a BST or heap, with a
					magical logarithmic balance: each node only votes - and cares - for
					the nodes immediately above and below. The top of the tree is not only
					indirect, but also distant: perhaps the president doesn't have to be
					such a big deal, since he's just dealing with super presidential
					things that don't directly concern or interest us. Votes bubble up the
					tree, policies trickle down. Politicians rise and fall via AVL
					rotations.
