			<h1>VSN-C Considered Harmful</h1>
			<p><a href="/">Joel Gustafson</a> / <a href="/thoughts">Thoughts</a></p>
			<section>
				<h2>Winston’s Contributions</h2>
				<p>
					Professor Winston’s AI seminar serves two parallel purposes: a survey
					of seminal papers in artificial intelligence, and a vehicle for what
					Winston calls the “VSN-C mantra”. This mantra, Vision-Steps-News and
					Contributions, is at once a way of writing, a way of reading, and a
					way of life. Winston argues that good writing, particularly in a
					research context: 1) first lays out the author's Vision, then 2) lists
					the Steps required to realize that vision, then 3) updates the reader
					with some News of original content, and 4) concludes by summarizing
					the author's Contributions to the field. This is marketed as a
					quick-and-dirty form for all of a student's communication needs, and
					is emphasized so as to border on dogma, with weekly exercises in
					writing various pieces in VSN-C and extracting VSN-C from
					insufficiently compliant works.
				</p>
				<p>
					I propose that this is harmful.

				<h2>Goodhart’s Law</h2>
				<p>
					The SAT was temporarily a good test. Its purpose was to evaluate
					“college readiness”, which it did well: even though the content of the
					test (e.g. obscure vocabulary knowledge) didn’t directly represent
					college readiness, the two were so closely correlated that they became
					interchangeable for evaluation. College readiness was testable by
					proxy via trivia, because trivia wasn’t known except by those ready
					for college.
				</p>
				<p>
					But soon, high school students bought practice books and memorized
					trivia directly, without the trouble of readying for college
					beforehand. Those convenient proxies became gameable, so the thing
					that the SAT really tested stopped being “college readiness” and
					became “proficiency at taking SAT tests”. This phenomenon is so common
					(and so commonly discussed) that it has least three names (Goodhart’s
					Law, Campbell’s Law, and the Cobra Effect). If names give you power
					over things, we certainly should have tamed this one by now! Yet it
					lives on, in high school exams, teacher evaluations, or any metric
					susceptible to feedback loops.
				</p>
				<p>
					Academic publication is another such metric. Publication, after all,
					should not be the goal of any researcher. Publication is the
					evaluation of research done well. Research is done for advancement,
					for discovery, for exploration, for science! But if research is ever
					done to be published, then publications become journals not of the
					best research, but only of the most publishable. “When a measure
					becomes a target,” Charles Goodhart wrote, “it ceases to be a good
					measure.”
				</p>
				<p>
					This is one insidious danger of VSN-C. Just as the SAT discreetly
					substituted college readiness for vocabulary memorization, emphasizing
					frameworks like VSN-C substitute an idea for its presentation. These
					may be correlated, but are not at all the same, thereby rendering
					writers vulnerable to feedback loops in pursuit of VSN-C conformance.
					Many good papers may happen to follow VSN-C, and VSN-C may make some
					writing more compelling or memorable or publishable, but identifying
					those as primary goals to write for is dangerous.
				</p>
				<p>
					Another side effect of the SAT’s vocabulary obsession is that high
					schoolers feel pressured to use large words in essays that they might
					not feel comfortable with. Similarly, an obsession with VSN-C
					pressures young academics to hallucinate visions and pull
					contributions from out of the void to justify what might already have
					been a perfectly self-contained idea. Applying VSN-C too liberally
					inflates papers and distracts from whatever core they originally
					wanted to communicate.
				</p>
				<p>
					Intentional or not, VSN-C implies priorities that value being read and
					easily summarized over the authentic expression of an original idea.
					Even worse, these priorities propagate backwards to prime students to
					seek ideas that can easily fit the VSN-C form, severely restricting
					the concept-space they might otherwise explore.

				<h2>McLuhan’s Message</h2>
				<p>
					In Computer Science, code is strictly separated from the data that
					passes through it. Structure is distinct from content. Information can
					be cast from type to type, transmuted from form to form, serialized
					and deserialized - always perfectly recoverable. Its representation
					seems independent of its essence.
				</p>
				<p>
					The real world is not like this. The Mona Lisa cannot be reconstructed
					from a poem, no matter how vividly written. No infographic can
					recreate Ozymandias, and no single picture can capture the
					kinesthetics of a ballet. Any message is inextricably intertwined with
					its medium.
				</p>
				<p>
					But it is tempting for computer scientists to deny this. It is
					particularly tempting with pieces not normally considered artistic,
					like research papers or grant applications or PhD theses. "Have an
					idea?", Winston asks, "Just serialize it into VSN-C! Then anyone can
					read it!". But that's not true! Like a haiku retelling of Swan Lake,
					it may be good, but it’s no longer the same.
				</p>
				<p>
					Translating a message across mediums preserves some of its aspects,
					but irreversibly mutates others. Worse, the new medium projects its
					own connotations onto the message. By writing “in” VSN-C, your ideas
					get overshadowed by the narrative that VSN-C imposes. This may be
					desirable for some, but putting the medium before the message doesn’t
					give your ideas a chance: they’re immediately branded with VSN-C,
					associated with all of the other VSN-C papers the audience has read,
					and subconsciously aligned with previous work. For incremental
					contributions, this could be an advantage, as it lets readers quickly
					parse the paper and place it in existing context, but for truly novel
					works, this positioning detracts from its apparent significance. VSN-C
					as a medium reeks of bite-sized second-semester MEng theses written
					just before deadlines.
				</p>
				<p>
					Instead, effectively communicating an idea means guarding every shred
					of originality and designing the method of communication around the
					message itself. Human perception is wonderfully sensitive, but with it
					comes great responsibility to share our ideas carefully, with clarity
					and authenticity.

				<h2>Minsky’s Medium</h2>
				<p>
					Marvin Minsky’s perspective on the architecture of the mind is not
					easily stated. It is abstract and difficult to reify. It is not one
					single idea, but many pieces that fit together to form a cohesive view
					that only makes sense holistically. It is not supported by
					experimental evidence, and requires the supposition of completely new
					objects like agents and k-lines.
				</p>
				<p>
					Minsky could have written Society of Mind serially, like any other
					book. But Minsky knew that he was not trying to write about a serial
					idea - instead, he was writing about a collection of little ideas that
					create a whole. His message was fundamentally one of synthesis, so
					rather than twist it into a wall of text, he wrote it as he imagined
					it: a scattering of bite-sized atoms, with flexible dependencies
					instead of rigid order, and explicit relations between each other.
					Minsky created a new, novel medium around his new, novel message. A
					VSN-C treatment of Society may have checked all of Winston’s technical
					boxes, but would have nowhere near its intrigue or allure.

				<h2>Gustafson’s Objection</h2>
				<p>
					Professor Winston has been teaching at MIT for longer than I have been
					alive, and reading and writing papers for much longer. Certainly he,
					more than anyone else, can be expected to give safe, reliable advice
					on how to produce a reasonable paper that will pass thesis defence or
					get accepted to a journal. VSN-C is an effective formula. This I do
					not doubt.
				</p>
				<p>
					But I object to the premise of VSN-C. I object to the idea of writing
					with a purpose to be read or remembered or published. Writing, and
					particularly academic writing, is not persuasion: it is communication,
					and communicating well means framing your writing around your ideas,
					wherever that may lead.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even more serious than my ethical objection is the harm VSN-C poses to
					students, whose thoughts are more creative and minds more expressive
					than they ever will be again. VSN-C has a chilling effect on this
					creativity, through academic feedback loops and backpropagation of
					VSN-C’s formulaic style. While frameworks can certainly be useful,
					great care must be taken to limit their influences and qualify their
					application.
				</p>
				<p>
					It strikes me as the strangest of ironies that a professor pursuing
					human story-understanding would propose a writing style that seems
					designed for a machine to parse. We want computers to become more
					human - not vice versa! If creativity is our greatest power, then it
					is the wild and chaotic and expressive that we must value, not the
					mechanical and robotic.
