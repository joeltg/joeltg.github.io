            Turing proposes reducing the bandwidth of communication from normal interaction to texting.

            But take it a step further, and image an imitation game where the participants can only send binary dots across some telegraph wire - likely any sporatic variant on echoing will convince a judge.
            Intuitively, one would say that "It isn't enough information to really capture thought" and then we have a slippery slope from face-to-face interaction to texting to telegraphing.
            Who's to say what's "enough" - perhaps Turing's proposal is just well-placed on the slope to still stimulate interest and (so far) elude computation.
