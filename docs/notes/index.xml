      <description>It was a brisk fall day and Alice and the Dormouse where wandering around town. The Dormouse saw a $20 bill on the ground and went over to pick it up.
&amp;ldquo;Ah, don&amp;rsquo;t bother&amp;rdquo; said Alice.
&amp;ldquo;Why not?&amp;rdquo; said the Dormouse.
&amp;ldquo;Well if it were a real, somebody else would have taken it already. So it must be fake.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Oh that&amp;rsquo;s not a problem for me. You see, I don&amp;rsquo;t believe in the efficient market hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Repetition is the shadow of structure</title>

      <description>One of my favorite thoughts recently is the sacred value of repetition. You can escalate any conversation into mystical territory just by saying the same sentence over and over again, and everyone (you included!) will start to hallucinate loads of meaning behind it. I think it&amp;rsquo;s just exploiting a good-faith social assumption of &amp;ldquo;I guess that means I must not have understood it the (n)th time, so I&amp;rsquo;ll think harder about it&amp;rdquo;, but it&amp;rsquo;s still effective.</description>

      <title>Forgetting to Forget</title>

      <description>Claude Monet once said
 When you go out to paint, try to forget what objects you have before you, a tree, a house, a field or whatever. Merely think here is a little square of blue, here an oblong of pink, here a streak of yellow, and paint it just as it looks to you, the exact color and shape.
 and again even more concisely:
 To see we must forget the name of the thing we are looking at.</description>

      <title>Raspberry Mint</title>

      <description>It tastes like raspberry mint. It smells like rain and pine needles. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly cloudy, it&amp;rsquo;s grinning during the comedown.
It looks like finger guns and mouthing &amp;ldquo;my guy&amp;rdquo; at yourself in the mirror. It&amp;rsquo;s Marianne Williamson talking about love. It&amp;rsquo;s Greta and Grimes and Catholic TikTok. It&amp;rsquo;s a negotiation and an open circuit and a hand on a rudder in a really big sea. It&amp;rsquo;s real but not hyperreal, and it&amp;rsquo;s full of texture and detail.</description>
