				<p>
					Hi! I'm Joel.
				</p>
				<p>
					I care about a lot of Big Ideas, and want to make computing
					universally accessible to everyone as a medium and an art. I believe
					in direct manipulation of data, augmenting human intellect, and
					dynamic, interactive documents, unlike most of the ones you’ll find
					here.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of my projects are a bit weird (that’s deliberate) and some of my
					heroes are a bit eccentric (that’s unfortunate). I only hope they’re
					thought-provoking.

				<h2>Work</h2>
				<p>
					In 2018 I joined <a href="https://protocol.ai">Protocol Labs</a> as an
					independent researcher.
				</p>
				<p>
					In summer 2017 I worked on
					<a href="https://www.notion.so/">Notion</a>, a Lego-like composable
					productivity tool. I wrote a DSL and designed an editor for querying
					and computing on structured data.

					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					In summer 2016 I started working with Gerry Sussman and Jack Wisdom to
					redesign the online notes for 6.946: Computational Classical
					Mechanics. The project spiralled into symbolic Scheme
					<a href="/ozymandias/">programming environment</a> in the browser and
					a native <a href="/projects/mit-scheme-kernel/">Jupyter kernel</a>.

					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Before that, I worked in the
					<a href="http://viral.media.mit.edu/">Viral Communications Group</a>
					at the Media Lab as an undergraduate researcher with
					<a href="http://www.travisrich.com/">Travis Rich</a> on
					<a href="https://www.pubpub.org/">PubPub</a>, a platform for free and
					open academic publishing. PubPub emphasizes radical transparency,
					hosts curated grassroots journals, and weaves an intertwingled mesh of
					natively digital documents.

				<h2>Education</h2>
				<p>
					I graduated from MIT in 2018 with a BS in Mathematics with Computer
					Science. You can check out all the classes I took on
					<a href="https://courseroad.mit.edu/#joelg">Courseroad</a>, but here
					are some highlights:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Automata, Computability, and Complexity (Scott Aaronson)</li>
					<li>Adventures in Symbolic Programming (Gerry Sussman)</li>
					<li>Magic as Interface, Technology, and Design (NovySan)</li>
					<li>Design Across Scales (Meejin Yoon & Neeri Oxman)</li>
					<li>Quantum Computation (Seth Lloyd)</li>
					<li>Human Intelligence Enterprise (Patrick Henry Winston)</li>
					<li>Cryptography and Cryptanalysis (Shafi Goldwasser)</li>
					<li>How To Make (almost) Anything (Neil Gershenfeld)</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Heroes</h2>
				<p>
					These are just a few of the people who continually inspire me with the
					depth of their perception and the extent of their vision. Maybe
					someday we’ll realize their dreams, but until then, with ideas that
					are still radical, we fight on.
