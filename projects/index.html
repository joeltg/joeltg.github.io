        <p>
            Scheme is a beautiful language, but for those afraid of Emacs it can be difficult to use, and things that are difficult to use are difficult to learn.
            Ozymandias is a modern MIT Scheme environment in the browser that tries its best to be friendly and usable.

        <h2><a href="/projects/visual-history">Visual History</a></h2>
        <p>
            Modern browsers lose rich information when they compress browsing history into a linear stack, which makes backtracking from a forest of links surprisingly difficult.
            We can do better.

        <p>
            It’s easy to look at lines of code and think you know what programming is, but text is only one of many possible representations.
            GRASP visualizes Scheme ASTs with as little text as possible, using a force-directed 3D graph to organize the program’s structure.
