<h1>Things could be different, but they&#39;re not</h1>
<p class="subtitle">February 23, 2021</p>
<section>
<p>It was a brisk fall day and Alice and the Dormouse where wandering around town. The Dormouse saw a $20 bill on the ground and went over to pick it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, don&rsquo;t bother&rdquo; said Alice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; said the Dormouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well if it were a real, somebody else would have taken it already. So it must be fake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s not a problem for me. You see, I don&rsquo;t believe in the efficient market hypothesis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Alice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s unfalsifiable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; the Dormouse smiled. &ldquo;Have you ever heard of anyone falsifying it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not&hellip;&rdquo; said Alice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly&rdquo; said the Dormouse. &ldquo;If it were falsifiable, somebody would certainly have falsified it by now. So it must not be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess that makes sense,&rdquo; said Alice, &ldquo;but how is that different from things that are just <em>true</em>? They&rsquo;re all unfalsifiable too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good point!&rdquo; said the Dormouse. &ldquo;No true thing can be proven wrong. So if you ever encounter something that <em>can</em> be proven wrong, you can rule it out right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t falsifiability supposed to rule out theories that <em>can&rsquo;t</em> be proven wrong? Which is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good grief, you&rsquo;re right&rdquo; said the Dormouse. &ldquo;I guess we have to rule those ones out too.&rdquo;</p>
